# Leaf-Disease-Detection
Plant diseases causes many significant damages and losses in crops
around the world. Appropriate measures on disease identification should
be introduced to prevent the problems and minimize the losses.
Technical approaches using machine learning and computer vision are
actively researched to achieve intelligence farming by early detection on
plant disease.
An application is obviously desirable to aid the farmers or garden
enthusiasts in diagnosing what sorts of diseases a plant has. Although
some similar applications exist, most of them achieve the function by
submitting the image to a team of plant pathologists or expert garden
advisers to get possible identification results and some advise.
